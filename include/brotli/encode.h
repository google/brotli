/* Progressively compress input stream and push produced bytes to output stream.
   Internally workflow consists of 3 tasks:
    * (optional) copy input data to internal buffer
    * actually compress data and (optionally) store it to internal buffer
    * (optional) copy compressed bytes from internal buffer to output stream
   Whenever all 3 tasks can't move forward anymore, or error occurs, this
   method returns.

   |available_in| and |next_in| represent input stream; when X bytes of input
   are consumed, X is subtracted from |available_in| and added to |next_in|.
   |available_out| and |next_out| represent output stream; when Y bytes are
   pushed to output, Y is subtracted from |available_out| and added to
   |next_out|. |total_out|, if it is not a null-pointer, is assigned to the
   total amount of bytes pushed by the instance of encoder to output.

   |op| is used to perform flush or finish the stream.

   Flushing the stream means forcing encoding of all input passed to encoder and
   completing the current output block, so it could be fully decoded by stream
   decoder. To perform flush |op| must be set to BROTLI_OPERATION_FLUSH. Under
   some circumstances (e.g. lack of output stream capacity) this operation would
   require several calls to BrotliEncoderCompressStream. The method must be
   called again until both input stream is depleted and encoder has no more
   output (see BrotliEncoderHasMoreOutput) after the method is called.

   Finishing the stream means encoding of all input passed to encoder and
   adding specific "final" marks, so stream decoder could determine that stream
   is complete. To perform finish |op| must be set to BROTLI_OPERATION_FINISH.
   Under some circumstances (e.g. lack of output stream capacity) this operation
   would require several calls to BrotliEncoderCompressStream. The method must
   be called again until both input stream is depleted and encoder has no more
   output (see BrotliEncoderHasMoreOutput) after the method is called.

   WARNING: when flushing and finishing, |op| should not change until operation
   is complete; input stream should not be refilled as well.

   Returns 0 if there was an error and 1 otherwise.
