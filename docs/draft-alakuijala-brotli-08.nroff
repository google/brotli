1. Introduction

.ti 0
1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to define a lossless
compressed data format that:

.nf
   * Is independent of CPU type, operating system, file system,
     and character set, and hence can be used for interchange;
   * Can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long
     sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a
     priori bounded amount of intermediate storage, and hence
     can be used in data communications or similar structures,
     such as Unix filters;
   * Compresses data with a compression ratio comparable to the
     best currently available general-purpose compression methods,
     and in particular, considerably better than the gzip program;
   * Decompresses much faster than current LZMA implementations.
.fi

The data format defined by this specification does not attempt to:

.nf
   * Allow random access to compressed data;
   * Compress specialized data (e.g., raster graphics) as well
     as the best currently available specialized algorithms.
.fi

1.2. Intended audience

This specification is intended for use by software implementers
to compress data into and/or decompress data from the brotli format.

The text of the specification assumes a basic background in
programming at the level of bits and other primitive data
representations. Familiarity with the technique of Huffman coding
is helpful but not required.

This specification uses heavily the notations and terminology
introduced in the DEFLATE format specification [RFC 1951].
For the sake of completeness, we always
include the whole text of the relevant parts of RFC 1951,
therefore familiarity with the DEFLATE format is helpful but not
required.

The compressed data format defined in this specification is
an integral part of the WOFF 2.0 web font file format [WOFF2],
therefore this specification is also intended for implementers of
WOFF 2.0 compressors and decompressors.

.ti 0
1.3. Scope

The specification specifies a method for representing a sequence
of bytes as a (usually shorter) sequence of bits, and a method for
packing the latter bit sequence into bytes.

.ti 0
1.4. Compliance

Unless otherwise indicated below, a compliant decompressor must be
able to accept and decompress any data set that conforms to all
the specifications presented here. A compliant compressor must
produce data sets that conform to all the specifications presented
here.

.ti 0
1.5. Definitions of terms and conventions used

Byte: 8 bits stored or transmitted as a unit (same as an octet).
For this specification, a byte is exactly 8 bits, even on machines
that store a character on a number of bits different from eight.
See below for the numbering of bits within a byte.

String: a sequence of arbitrary bytes.

Bytes stored within a computer do not have a "bit order", since
they are always treated as a unit. However, a byte considered as
an integer between 0 and 255 does have a most- and
least-significant bit, and since we write numbers with the
most-significant digit on the left, we also write bytes with the
most-significant bit on the left. In the diagrams below, we number
the bits of a byte so that bit 0 is the least-significant bit, i.e.,
the bits are numbered:

.nf
   +--------+
   |76543210|
   +--------+
.fi

Within a computer, a number may occupy multiple bytes. All
multi-byte numbers in the format described here are stored with
the least-significant byte first (at the lower memory address).
For example, the decimal number 520 is stored as:

.nf
   0        1
   +--------+--------+
   |00001000|00000010|
   +--------+--------+
   ^        ^
   |        |
   |        + more significant byte = 2 x 256
   + less significant byte = 8
.fi

.ti 0
1.5.1. Packing into bytes

This document does not address the issue of the order in which
bits of a byte are transmitted on a bit-sequential medium,
since the final data format described here is byte- rather than
bit-oriented. However, we describe the compressed block format
below as a sequence of data elements of various bit
lengths, not a sequence of bytes. We must therefore specify
how to pack these data elements into bytes to form the final
compressed byte sequence:

.nf
   * Data elements are packed into bytes in order of
     increasing bit number within the byte, i.e., starting
     with the least-significant bit of the byte.
   * Data elements other than prefix codes are packed
     starting with the least-significant bit of the data
     element. These are referred to here as integer values
     and are considered unsigned.
   * Prefix codes are packed starting with the most-significant
     bit of the code.
.fi

In other words, if one were to print out the compressed data as
a sequence of bytes, starting with the first byte at the
*right* margin and proceeding to the *left*, with the
most-significant bit of each byte on the left as usual, one would
be able to parse the result from right to left, with fixed-width
elements in the correct MSB-to-LSB order and prefix codes in
bit-reversed order (i.e., with the first bit of the code in the
relative LSB position).

2. Compressed representation overview

A compressed data set consists of a header and a series of
meta-blocks. Each meta-block decompresses to a sequence of 0
to 16,777,216 (16 MiB) uncompressed bytes. The final uncompressed data is
the concatenation of the uncompressed sequences from each meta-block.

The header contains the size of the sliding window that was used during compression.
The decompressor must retain at least that amount of uncompressed data prior to the
current position in the stream, in order to be able to decompress
what follows. The sliding window size is a power of two, minus 16, where
the power is in the range of 10 to 24. The possible sliding window
sizes range from 1 KiB - 16 B to 16 MiB - 16 B.

Each meta-block is compressed using a combination of the LZ77
algorithm (Lempel-Ziv 1977, [LZ77]) and Huffman coding. The
result of Huffman coding is referred to here as a prefix code.
The prefix codes for each meta-block are independent of
those for previous or subsequent meta-blocks; the LZ77 algorithm may
use a reference to a duplicated string occurring in a previous
meta-block, up to the sliding window size of uncompressed bytes before.
In addition, in the brotli format, a string reference may instead refer
to a static dictionary entry.

Each meta-block consists of two parts: a meta-block header that
describes the representation of the compressed data part, and a
compressed data part. The compressed data consists of a series of
commands. Each command consists of two parts: a sequence of literal
bytes (of strings that have not been detected as duplicated within
the sliding window), and a pointer to a duplicated string,
represented as a pair <length, backward distance>. There can be
zero literal bytes in the command. The minimum length of the string to be
duplicated is two, but the last command in the meta-block is permitted to have
only literals and no pointer to a string to duplicate.

Each command in the compressed data is represented using three categories
of prefix codes:

.nf
   1) One set of prefix codes are for the literal sequence lengths
      (also referred to as literal insertion lengths) and
      backward copy lengths. That is, a single code word represents
      two lengths, one of the literal sequence and one of the
      backward copy.

   2) One set of prefix codes are for literals.

   3) One set of prefix codes are for distances.
.fi

The prefix code descriptions for each meta-block appear in a compact
form just before the compressed data in the meta-block header.
The insert-and-copy length and distance prefix codes may be followed by
extra bits that are added to the base values determined by the codes.
The number of extra bits is determined by the code.

One meta-block command then appears as a sequence of prefix codes:

.nf
   Insert-and-copy length, literal, literal, ..., literal, distance
.fi

where the insert-and-copy defines an insertion length and a copy length.
The insertion length determines the number of literals that immediately
follow. The distance defines how far back to go for the copy and the
copy length determines the number of bytes to copy. The resulting
uncompressed data is the sequence of bytes:

.nf
   literal, literal, ..., literal, copy, copy, ..., copy
.fi

where the number of literal bytes and copy bytes are determined by the
insert-and-copy length code. (The number of bytes copied for a static
dictionary entry can vary from the copy length.)

The last command in the meta-block may end with the last literal if the
total uncompressed length of the meta-block has been satisfied. In
that case there is no distance in the last command, and the copy length is
ignored.

There can be more than one prefix code for each category, where the
prefix code to use for the next element of that category is determined
by the context of the compressed stream that precedes that element.
Part of that context is three current block types, one for each
category. A block type is in the range of 0..255. For each category
there is a count of how many elements of that category remain to be
decoded using the current block type. Once that count is expended,
a new block type and block count is read from the stream immediately
preceding the next element of that category, which will use the new
block type.

The insert-and-copy block type directly determines which prefix code to
use for the next insert-and-copy element. For the literal and distance
elements, the respective block type is used in combination with other
context information to determine which prefix code to use for the next
element.

Consider the following example:

.nf
   (IaC0, L0, L1, L2, D0)(IaC1, D1)(IaC2, L3, L4, D2)(IaC3, L5, D3)
.fi

The meta-block here has four commands, contained in parentheses for clarity,
where each of the three categories of
symbols within these commands can be interpreted using different block types.
Here we separate out each category as its own sequence to show an example of block
types assigned to those elements. Each square-bracketed group is a block that
uses the same block type:

.nf
   [IaC0, IaC1][IaC2, IaC3]  <-- insert-and-copy: block types 0 and 1

   [L0, L1][L2, L3, L4][L5]  <-- literals: block types 0, 1, and 0

   [D0][D1, D2, D3]          <-- distances: block types 0 and 1
.fi

The subsequent blocks within each block category must have different
block types, but we see that block types can be reused later in the meta-block.
The block types are numbered from 0 to the maximum
block type number of 255 and the first block of each block category
is type 0. The block structure of a meta-block is represented
by the sequence of block-switch commands for each block category,
where a block-switch command is a pair <block type, block count>.
The block-switch commands are represented in the compressed data
before the start of each new block using a prefix code for
block types and a separate prefix code for block counts for
each block category. For the above example the physical layout of the
meta-block is then:

.nf
   IaC0 L0 L1 LBlockSwitch(1, 3) L2 D0 IaC1 DBlockSwitch(1, 3) D1
   IaCBlockSwitch(1, 2) IaC2 L3 L4 D2 IaC3 LBlockSwitch(0, 1) L5 D3
.fi

where xBlockSwitch(t, n) switches to block type t for a count of n elements.
Note that in this example DBlockSwitch(1, 3) immediately precedes the
next required distance D1. It does not follow the last distance of
the previous block, D0. Whenever an element of a category is needed,
and the block count for that category has reached zero, then a new
block type and count is read from the stream just before reading that next
element.

The block-switch commands for the first blocks of each category are not part
of the meta-block compressed data. Instead the first block type
is defined to be 0, and the first block count for each category is
encoded in the meta-block header. The prefix codes for the block types and counts, a total of
six prefix codes over the three categories, are defined in a compact form in the meta-block
header.

Each category of value (insert-and-copy lengths, literals, and distances)
can be encoded with any prefix code from a collection of prefix
codes belonging to the same category appearing in the meta-block header. The
particular prefix code used can depend on two factors: the block
type of the block the value appears in, and the context of the value.
In the case of the literals, the context is the previous two bytes in
the uncompressed data, and in the case of distances, the context is the copy
length from the same command. For insert-and-copy lengths, no context
is used and the prefix code depends only on the block type. In the case
of literals and distances, the context is mapped to a context ID in
the range 0..63 for literals and 0..3 for distances. The matrix
of the prefix code indexes for each block type and context ID,
called the context map, is encoded in a compact form in the meta-block header.

For example, the prefix code to use to decode L2 depends on the
block type (1), and the literal context ID determined by the two uncompressed
bytes that were decoded from L0 and L1.
Similarly, the prefix code to use to decode D0 depends on the block
type (0), and the distance context ID determined by the copy length decoded
from IaC0. The prefix code to use to decode IaC3 depends only on the block
type (1).

In addition to the parts listed above (prefix code for insert-and-copy
lengths, literals, distances, block types and block counts,
and the context map), the meta-block header contains the number of
uncompressed bytes coded in the meta-block and two additional parameters used in
the representation of match distances: the number of postfix bits and
the number of direct distance codes.

A compressed meta-block may be marked in the header as the last meta-block,
which terminates the compressed stream.

A meta-block may instead simply store the uncompressed data directly as
bytes on byte boundaries with no coding or matching strings. In this
case the meta-block header information only contains the number of
uncompressed bytes and the indication that the meta-block is uncompressed.
An uncompressed meta-block cannot be the last meta-block.

A meta-block may also be empty, which generates no uncompressed data at all.
An empty meta-block may contain metadata information as bytes starting on byte
boundaries, which are not part of either the sliding window or the uncompressed
data. Thus, these metadata bytes cannot be used to create matching strings in
subsequent meta-blocks and are not used as context bytes for literals.

3.1. Introduction to prefix coding

Prefix coding represents symbols from an a priori known alphabet
by bit sequences (codes), one code for each symbol, in a manner
such that different symbols may be represented by bit sequences of
different lengths, but a parser can always parse an encoded string
unambiguously symbol-by-symbol.

We define a prefix code in terms of a binary tree in which the two
edges descending from each non-leaf node are labeled 0 and 1 and
in which the leaf nodes correspond one-for-one with (are labeled
with) the symbols of the alphabet; then the code for a symbol is
the sequence of 0's and 1's on the edges leading from the root to
the leaf labeled with that symbol. For example:

.nf
.KS
            /\\              Symbol    Code
           0  1             ------    ----
          /    \\                A     00
         /\\     B               B     1
        0  1                    C     011
       /    \\                   D     010
      A     /\\
           0  1
          /    \\
         D      C
.KE
.fi

A parser can decode the next symbol from the compressed stream
by walking down the tree from the root, at each step choosing the
edge corresponding to the next compressed data bit.

Given an alphabet with known symbol frequencies, the Huffman
algorithm allows the construction of an optimal prefix code (one
which represents strings with those symbol frequencies using the
fewest bits of any possible prefix codes for that alphabet). Such
a prefix code is called a Huffman code. (See [HUFFMAN] in Chapter 5,
references for additional information on Huffman codes.)

Note that in the brotli format, the prefix codes for the
various alphabets must not exceed certain maximum code lengths.
This constraint complicates the algorithm for computing code
lengths from symbol frequencies. Again, see Chapter 5, references
for details.

.ti 0
3.2. Use of prefix coding in the brotli format

The prefix codes used for each alphabet in the brotli format
are canonical prefix codes, which have two additional rules:

.nf
   * All codes of a given bit length have lexicographically
     consecutive values, in the same order as the symbols they
     represent;

   * Shorter codes lexicographically precede longer codes.
.fi

We could recode the example above to follow this rule as follows,
assuming that the order of the alphabet is ABCD:

.nf
.KS
   Symbol  Code
   ------  ----
   A       10
   B       0
   C       110
   D       111
.KE
.fi

I.e., 0 precedes 10, which precedes 11x, and 110 and 111 are
lexicographically consecutive.

Given this rule, we can define the canonical prefix code for an
alphabet just by giving the bit lengths of the codes for each
symbol of the alphabet in order; this is sufficient to determine
the actual codes. In our example, the code is completely defined
by the sequence of bit lengths (2, 1, 3, 3). The following
algorithm generates the codes as integers, intended to be read
from most- to least-significant bit. The code lengths are
initially in tree[I].Len; the codes are produced in tree[I].Code.

.nf
   1) Count the number of codes for each code length. Let
      bl_count[N] be the number of codes of length N, N >= 1.

   2) Find the numerical value of the smallest code for each
      code length:

.KS
         code = 0;
         bl_count[0] = 0;
         for (bits = 1; bits <= MAX_BITS; bits++) {
            code = (code + bl_count[bits-1]) << 1;
            next_code[bits] = code;
         }
.KE

   3) Assign numerical values to all codes, using consecutive
      values for all codes of the same length with the base
      values determined at step 2. Codes that are never used
      (which have a bit length of zero) must not be assigned a
      value.

.KS
         for (n = 0; n <= max_code; n++) {
            len = tree[n].Len;
            if (len != 0) {
               tree[n].Code = next_code[len];
               next_code[len]++;
            }
         }
.KE
.fi

Example:

Consider the alphabet ABCDEFGH, with bit lengths (3, 3, 3, 3, 3,
2, 4, 4). After step 1, we have:

.nf
.KS
   N      bl_count[N]
   -      -----------
   2      1
   3      5
   4      2
.KE
.fi

Step 2 computes the following next_code values:

.nf
.KS
   N      next_code[N]
   -      ------------
   1      0
   2      0
   3      2
   4      14
.KE
.fi

Step 3 produces the following code values:

.nf
.KS
   Symbol Length   Code
   ------ ------   ----
   A       3       010
   B       3       011
   C       3       100
   D       3       101
   E       3       110
   F       2       00
   G       4       1110
   H       4       1111
.KE
.fi

3.3. Alphabet sizes

Prefix codes are used for different purposes in the brotli
format, and each purpose has a different alphabet size. For
literal codes the alphabet size is 256. For insert-and-copy
length codes the alphabet size is 704. For block count codes,
the alphabet size is 26. For distance codes, block type codes, and
the prefix codes used in compressing the context map, the
alphabet size is dynamic and is based on parameters defined in
later sections. The following table summarizes the alphabet sizes
for the various prefix codes and the sections where they are defined.

.nf

   | Prefix code     | Alphabet size           | Definition |

3.4. Simple prefix codes

The first two bits of the compressed representation of each
prefix code distinguish between simple and complex prefix
codes. If this value is 1, then a simple prefix code follows
as described in this section. Otherwise, a complex prefix code
follows as described in Section 3.5.

A simple prefix code can have only up to four symbols with
non-zero code length. The format of the simple prefix code is as
follows:

.nf
   2 bits: value of 1 indicates a simple prefix code
   2 bits: NSYM - 1, where NSYM = # of symbols coded

   NSYM symbols, each encoded using ALPHABET_BITS bits

   1 bit:  tree-select, present only for NSYM = 4
.fi

The value of ALPHABET_BITS depends on the alphabet of the prefix
code: it is the smallest number of bits that can represent all
symbols in the alphabet. E.g. for the alphabet of literal bytes,
ALPHABET_BITS is 8. The value of each of the NSYM symbols above is
the value of the ALPHABETS_BITS width integer value. If the integer
value is greater than or equal to the alphabet size, or the value
is identical to a previous value, then the stream should be rejected
as invalid.

Note that the NSYM symbols may not be presented in sorted order. Prefix codes
of the same bit length must be assigned to the symbols in sorted order.

The (non-zero) code lengths of the symbols can be reconstructed as
follows:

.nf
   * if NSYM = 1, the code length for the one symbol is zero --
     when encoding this symbol in the
     compressed data stream using this prefix code, no
     actual bits are emitted. Similarly, when decoding a symbol
     using this prefix code, no bits are read and the one symbol
     is returned.

   * if NSYM = 2, both symbols have code length 1.

   * if NSYM = 3, the code lengths for the symbols are 1, 2, 2 in
     the order they appear in the representation of the simple
     prefix code.

   * if NSYM = 4, the code lengths (in order of symbols decoded)
     depend on the tree-select bit: 2, 2, 2, 2 (tree-select bit 0),
     or 1, 2, 3, 3 (tree-select bit 1).
.fi

.ti 0
3.5. Complex prefix codes

A complex prefix code is a canonical prefix code, defined by the
sequence of code lengths, as discussed in Section 3.2., above.
For even greater compactness, the code length sequences themselves
are compressed using a prefix code. The alphabet for code lengths
is as follows:

.nf
   0 - 15: Represent code lengths of 0 - 15
       16: Copy the previous non-zero code length 3 - 6 times
           The next 2 bits indicate repeat length
                 (0 = 3, ... , 3 = 6)
           If this is the first code length, or all previous
           code lengths are zero, a code length of 8 is
           repeated 3 - 6 times
           A repeated code length code of 16 modifies the
           repeat count of the previous one as follows:
              repeat count = (4 * (repeat count - 2)) +
                             (3 - 6 on the next 2 bits)
           Example:  Codes 7, 16 (+2 bits 11), 16 (+2 bits 10)
                     will expand to 22 code lengths of 7
                     (1 + 4 * (6 - 2) + 5)
       17: Repeat a code length of 0 for 3 - 10 times.
           (3 bits of length)
           A repeated code length code of 17 modifies the
           repeat count of the previous one as follows:
              repeat count = (8 * (repeat count - 2)) +
                             (3 - 10 on the next 3 bits)
.fi

Note that a code of 16 that follows an immediately preceding 16 modifies the
previous repeat count, which becomes the new repeat count. The same is true for
a 17 following a 17. A sequence of three or more 16 codes in a row or three of
more 17 codes in a row is possible, modifying the count each time. Only the
final repeat count is used. The modification only applies if the same code
follows. A 16 repeat does not modify an immediately preceding 17 count nor
vice versa.

A code length of 0 indicates that the corresponding symbol in the
alphabet will not occur in the compressed data, and should not
participate in the prefix code construction algorithm given
earlier. A complex prefix code must have at least two non-zero
code lengths.

The bit lengths of the prefix code over the code length alphabet
are compressed with the following variable length code (as it appears
in the compressed data, where the bits are parsed from right to left):

.nf
.KS
   Symbol   Code
   ------   ----
   0          00
   1        0111
   2         011
   3          10
   4          01
   5        1111
.KE
.fi

We can now define the format of the complex prefix code as follows:

.nf
   2 bits: HSKIP, values of 0, 2, or 3 represent the respective
           number of skipped code lengths. The skipped lengths
           are taken to be zero. (An HSKIP of 1 indicates a
           Simple prefix code.)

   Code lengths for symbols in the code length alphabet given
      just above, in the order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 17, 6, 16, 7,
      8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. If HSKIP is 2, then the
      code lengths for symbols 1 and 2 are zero, and the first
      code length is for symbol 3. If HSKIP is 3, then the code
      length for symbol 3 is also zero, and the first code length
      is for symbol 4.

      The code lengths of code length symbols are between 0 and
      5, and they are represented with 2 - 4 bits according to
      the variable length code above. A code length of 0 means
      the corresponding code length symbol is not used.

      If HSKIP is 2 or 3, a respective number of leading code
      lengths are implicit zeros and are not present in the
      code lengths sequence above.

      If there are at least two non-zero code lengths, any
      trailing zero code lengths are omitted, i.e. the last
      code length in the sequence must be non-zero. In this
      case, the sum of (32 >> code length) over all the non-zero
      code lengths must equal to 32.

      If the lengths have been read for the entire code length
      alphabet and there was only one non-zero code length,
      then the prefix code has one symbol whose code has zero
      length. In this case, that symbol results in no bits
      being emitted by the compressor, and no bits consumed by
      the decompressor. That single symbol is immediately
      returned when this code is decoded.
      An example of where this occurs is if the
      entire code to be represented has symbols of length 8.
      E.g. a literal code that represents all literal values
      with equal probability. In this case the single symbol
      is 16, which repeats the previous length. The previous
      length is taken to be 8 before any code length code
      lengths are read.

   Sequence of at most alphabet size code lengths symbols, encoded
      using the code length prefix code. Any trailing 0 or 17 must be
      omitted, i.e. the last encoded code length symbol must be
      between 1 and 16. The sum of (32768 >> code length) over
      all the non-zero code lengths in the alphabet, including
      those encoded using repeat code(s) of 16, must equal to
      32768. If the number of times to repeat the previous length
      or repeat a zero length would result in more lengths in
      total than the number of symbols in the alphabet, then the
      stream should be rejected as invalid.

4. Encoding of distances

As described in Section 2., one component of a compressed meta-block
is a sequence of backward distances. In this section we provide the
details to the encoding of distances.

Each distance in the compressed data part of a meta-block is
represented with a pair <distance code, extra bits>. The distance
code and the extra bits are encoded back-to-back, the distance code
is encoded using a prefix code over the distance alphabet,
while the extra bits value is encoded as a fixed-width integer
value. The number of extra bits can be 0 - 24, and it is dependent
on the distance code.

To convert a distance code and associated extra bits to a backward
distance, we need the sequence of past distances and two additional
parameters, the number of "postfix bits", denoted by NPOSTFIX (0..3), and
the number of direct distance codes, denoted by NDIRECT (0..120). Both of
these parameters are encoded in the meta-block header. We will also
use the following derived parameter:

.nf
   POSTFIX_MASK = (1 << NPOSTFIX) - 1
.fi

The first 16 distance symbols are special symbols that reference
past distances as follows:

.nf
   0: last distance
   1: second-to-last distance
   2: third-to-last distance
   3: fourth-to-last distance
   4: last distance - 1
   5: last distance + 1
   6: last distance - 2
   7: last distance + 2
   8: last distance - 3
   9: last distance + 3
  10: second-to-last distance - 1
  11: second-to-last distance + 1
  12: second-to-last distance - 2
  13: second-to-last distance + 2
  14: second-to-last distance - 3
  15: second-to-last distance + 3
.fi

The ring buffer of four last distances is initialized by the values
16, 15, 11, and 4 (i.e. the fourth-to-last is set to 16, the third-to-last
to 15, the second-to-last to 11, and the last distance to 4) at the
beginning of the *stream* (as opposed to the beginning of the meta-block)
and it is not reset at meta-block boundaries. When a distance
symbol 0 appears, the distance it represents (i.e. the last distance
in the sequence of distances) is not pushed to the ring buffer of
last distances, in other words, the expression "(second, third,
fourth)-to-last distance" means the (second, third, fourth)-to-last
distance that was not represented by a 0 distance symbol. Similarly,
distances that represent static dictionary words (see Section 8.) are
not pushed to the ring buffer of last distances.

If a special distance symbol resolves to a zero or negative value, the
stream should be rejected as invalid.

If NDIRECT is greater than zero, then the next NDIRECT distance symbols,
from 16 to 15 + NDIRECT, represent distances from 1 to NDIRECT.
Neither the special distance symbols, nor the NDIRECT direct distance
symbols are followed by any extra bits.

Distance symbols 16 + NDIRECT and greater all have extra bits, where the
number of extra bits for a distance symbol "dcode" is given by the
following formula:

.nf
   ndistbits = 1 + ((dcode - NDIRECT - 16) >> (NPOSTFIX + 1))
.fi

The maximum number of extra bits is 24, therefore the size of the
distance symbol alphabet is (16 + NDIRECT + (48 << NPOSTFIX)).

Given a distance symbol "dcode" (>= 16 + NDIRECT), and extra bits
"dextra", the backward distance is given by the following formula:

.nf
   hcode = (dcode - NDIRECT - 16) >> NPOSTFIX
   lcode = (dcode - NDIRECT - 16) & POSTFIX_MASK
   offset = ((2 + (hcode & 1)) << ndistbits) - 4
   distance = ((offset + dextra) << NPOSTFIX) + lcode + NDIRECT + 1
.fi

5. Encoding of literal insertion lengths and copy lengths

As described in Section 2., the literal insertion lengths and backward
copy lengths are encoded using a single prefix code. This section
provides the details to this encoding.

Each <insertion length, copy length> pair in the compressed data part
of a meta-block is represented with the following triplet:

.nf
   <insert-and-copy length code, insert extra bits, copy extra bits>
.fi

The insert-and-copy length code, the insert extra bits, and the copy
extra bits are encoded back-to-back, the insert-and-copy length code
is encoded using a prefix code over the insert-and-copy length code
alphabet, while the extra bits values are encoded as fixed-width
integer values. The number of insert and copy extra bits can be
0 - 24, and they are dependent on the insert-and-copy length code.

Some of the insert-and-copy length codes also express the fact that
the distance symbol of the distance in the same command is 0, i.e. the
distance component of the command is the same as that of the previous
command. In this case, the distance code and extra bits for the
distance are omitted from the compressed data stream.

We describe the insert-and-copy length code alphabet in terms of the
(not directly used) insert length code and copy length code
alphabets. The symbols of the insert length code alphabet, along with
the number of insert extra bits, and the range of the insert lengths
are as follows:

.nf
.KS

The symbols of the copy length code alphabet, along with the number
of copy extra bits, and the range of copy lengths are as follows:

To convert an insert-and-copy length code to an insert length code

First, look up the cell with the 64 value range containing the
insert-and-copy length code, this gives the insert length code and
the copy length code ranges, both 8 values long.
The copy length code within its range is determined by bits 0-2
(counted from the LSB) of the insert-and-copy length code.
The insert length code within its range is determined by bits 3-5
(counted from the LSB) of the insert-and-copy length code.
Given the insert length and copy length codes, the actual insert
and copy lengths can be obtained by reading the number of extra
bits given by the tables above.

If the insert-and-copy length code is between 0 and 127, the distance
code of the command is set to zero (the last distance reused).

6. Encoding of block switch commands

As described in Section 2., a block-switch command is a pair
<block type, block count>. These are encoded in the compressed data
part of the meta-block, right before the start of each new block of a
particular block category.

Each block type in the compressed data is represented with a block
type code, encoded using a prefix code over the block type code
alphabet. A block type symbol 0 means that the new block type is the same
as the type of the previous block from the same block category, i.e.
the block type that preceded the current type,
while a block type symbol 1 means that the new block type equals the current
block type plus one. If the current block type is the maximal possible,
then a block type symbol of 1 results in wrapping to a new block type of 0.
Block type symbols 2 - 257
represent block types 0 - 255 respectively. The previous and current block types
are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively, at the end of the
meta-block header.

Since the first block type of each block category is 0, the block
type of the first block-switch command is not encoded in
the compressed data. If a block category has only one block type,
the block count of the first block-switch command is also omitted from
the compressed data, otherwise it is encoded in the meta-block header.

Since the end of the meta-block is detected by the number of uncompressed
bytes produced, the block counts for any of the three categories need not
count down to exactly zero at the end of the meta-block.

The number of different block types in each block category, denoted
by NBLTYPESL, NBLTYPESI, and NBLTYPESD for literals, insert-and-copy
lengths, and distances, respectively, is encoded in the meta-block
header, and it must equal to the largest block type plus one in that
block category. In other words, the set of literal, insert-and-copy
length, and distance block types must be [0..NBLTYPESL-1],
[0..NBLTYPESI-1], and [0..NBLTYPESD-1], respectively. From this it
follows that the alphabet size of literal, insert-and-copy length, and
distance block type codes is NBLTYPESL + 2, NBLTYPESI + 2, and
NBLTYPESD + 2, respectively.

Each block count in the compressed data is represented with a pair
<block count code, extra bits>. The block count code and the extra
bits are encoded back-to-back, the block count code is encoded using
a prefix code over the block count code alphabet, while the extra
bits value is encoded as a fixed-width integer value. The number of
extra bits can be 0 - 24, and it is dependent on the block count
code. The symbols of the block count code alphabet, along with the
number of extra bits, and the range of block counts are as follows:

.nf
.KS

    4    3   17-24     13    5   145-176   22   11   2289-4336
    5    3   25-32     14    5   177-208   23   12   4337-8432
    6    3   33-40     15    5   209-240   24   13   8433-16624
    7    3   41-48     16    6   241-304   25   24   16625-16793840
    8    4   49-64     17    6   305-368
.KE

The first block-switch command of each block category is special in
the sense that it is encoded in the meta-block header, and as
described earlier, the block type code is omitted since it is an
implicit zero.

7. Context modeling

As described in Section 2., the prefix tree used to encode a literal
byte or a distance code depends on the block type and the context ID.
This section specifies how to compute the context ID for a particular
literal and distance code, and how to encode the context map that
maps a <block type, context ID> pair to the index of a prefix
code in the array of literal and distance prefix codes.

.ti 0
7.1. Context modes and context ID lookup for literals

The context for encoding the next literal is defined by the last
two bytes in the stream (p1, p2, where p1 is the most recent
byte), regardless of whether these bytes are produced by
uncompressed meta-blocks, backward references, static dictionary
references, or by literal insertions. At the start of the stream
p1 and p2 are initialized to zero.

There are four methods, called context modes, to compute the
Context ID:

.nf
   * LSB6, where the Context ID is the value of six
     least-significant bits of p1,
   * MSB6, where the Context ID is the value of six
     most-significant bits of p1,
   * UTF8, where the Context ID is a complex function of p1, p2,
     optimized for text compression, and
   * Signed, where Context ID is a complex function of p1, p2,
     optimized for compressing sequences of signed integers.
.fi

The Context ID for the UTF8 and Signed context modes is computed
using the following lookup tables Lut0, Lut1, and Lut2.

.nf
   Lut0 :=
      0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  4,  4,  0,  0,  4,  0,  0,

      8, 12, 16, 12, 12, 20, 12, 16, 24, 28, 12, 12, 32, 12, 36, 12,
     44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 32, 32, 24, 40, 28, 12,

.fi

The lengths and the zlib CRC-32 (ITU-T Recommendation V.42) check values
of each of these tables as a sequence of bytes are as follows:

.nf
   Table    Length    CRC-32
   -----    ------    ------
   Lut0     256       0x8e91efb7
   Lut1     256       0xd01a32f4
   Lut2     256       0x0dd7a0d6
.fi

Given p1 is the last uncompressed byte and p2 is the second-to-last
uncompressed byte, the context IDs can be computed as follows:

.nf
   For LSB6:    Context ID = p1 & 0x3f
   For MSB6:    Context ID = p1 >> 2
   For UTF8:    Context ID = Lut0[p1] | Lut1[p2]
   For Signed:  Context ID = (Lut2[p1] << 3) | Lut2[p2]
.fi

From the lookup tables defined above and the operations to compute the
context IDs, we can see that context IDs for literals are in the range
of 0..63.

The context modes LSB6, MSB6, UTF8, and Signed are denoted by
integers 0, 1, 2, 3.

A context mode is defined for each literal block type and they
are stored in a consecutive array of bits in the meta-block
header, always two bits per block type.

7.2. Context ID for distances

The context for encoding a distance code is defined by the copy
length corresponding to the distance. The context IDs are 0, 1, 2,
and 3 for copy lengths 2, 3, 4, and more than 4, respectively.

.ti 0
7.3. Encoding of the context map

There are two context maps, one for literals and one for
distances. The size of the context map is 64 * NBLTYPESL for
literals, and 4 * NBLTYPESD for distances. Each value in the
context map is an integer between 0 and 255, indicating the index
of the prefix code to be used when encoding the next literal or
distance.

The context maps are two-dimensional matrices, encoded as
one-dimensional arrays:

.nf
   CMAPL[0..(64 * NBLTYPESL - 1)]
   CMAPD[0..(4 * NBLTYPESD - 1)]
.fi

The index of the prefix code for encoding a literal or distance
code with block type, BTYPE_x, and context ID, CIDx, is:

.nf
   index of literal prefix code = CMAPL[64 * BTYPE_L + CIDL]
   index of distance prefix code = CMAPD[4 * BTYPE_D + CIDD]
.fi

The values of the context map are encoded with the combination
of run length encoding for zero values and prefix coding. Let
RLEMAX denote the number of run length codes and NTREES denote the
maximum value in the context map plus one. NTREES must equal the
number of different values in the context map, in other words,
the different values in the context map must be the [0..NTREES-1]
interval. The alphabet of the prefix code has the following
RLEMAX + NTREES symbols:

.nf
   0: value zero
   1: repeat a zero 2 to 3 times, read 1 bit for repeat length
   2: repeat a zero 4 to 7 times, read 2 bits for repeat length
   ...
   RLEMAX: repeat a zero (1 << RLEMAX) to (1 << (RLEMAX+1))-1
           times, read RLEMAX bits for repeat length
   RLEMAX + 1: value 1
   ...
   RLEMAX + NTREES - 1: value NTREES - 1
.fi

If RLEMAX = 0, the run length coding is not used, and the symbols
of the alphabet are directly the values in the context map. We can
now define the format of the context map (the same format is used
for literal and distance context maps):

.nf
   1-5 bits: RLEMAX, 0 is encoded with one 0 bit, and values
             1 - 16 are encoded with bit pattern xxxx1 (so 01001
             is 5)

   Prefix code with alphabet size NTREES + RLEMAX

   Context map size values encoded with the above prefix code
      and run length coding for zero values. If a run length
      would result in more lengths in total than the size of
      the context map, then the stream should be rejected as
      invalid.

   1 bit:  IMTF bit, if set, we do an inverse move-to-front
           transform on the values in the context map to get
           the prefix code indexes
.fi

Note that RLEMAX may be larger than the value necessary to represent
the longest sequence of zero values. Also, the NTREES value is encoded
right before the context map as described in Section 9.2.

We define the inverse move-to-front transform used in this specification
by the following C language function:

.nf
   void InverseMoveToFrontTransform(uint8_t* v, int v_len) {
      uint8_t mtf[256];
      int i;
      for (i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
         mtf[i] = (uint8_t)i;
      }
      for (i = 0; i < v_len; ++i) {
         uint8_t index = v[i];
         uint8_t value = mtf[index];
         v[i] = value;
         for (; index; --index) {
            mtf[index] = mtf[index - 1];
         }
         mtf[0] = value;
      }
   }
.fi

Note that the inverse move-to-front transform will not produce values
outside the [0..NTREES-1] interval.

8. Static dictionary

At any given point during decoding the compressed data, a reference
to a duplicated string in the uncompressed data produced so far has a maximum
backward distance value, which is the minimum of the window size and
the number of uncompressed bytes produced. However, decoding a distance
from the compressed stream, as described in Section 4., can produce
distances that are greater than this maximum allowed value. In this case,
the distance is treated as a reference to a word in the static dictionary
given in Appendix A. The copy length for a static dictionary reference
must be between 4 and 24. The static dictionary has three parts:

.nf
   * DICT[0..DICTSIZE], an array of bytes
   * DOFFSET[0..24], an array of byte offset values for each length
   * NDBITS[0..24], an array of bit-depth values for each length
.fi

The number of static dictionary words for a given length is:

.nf
   NWORDS[length] = 0                       (if length < 4)
   NWORDS[length] = (1 << NDBITS[length])   (if length >= 4)
.fi

DOFFSET and DICTSIZE are defined by the following recursion:

.nf
   DOFFSET[0] = 0
   DOFFSET[length + 1] = DOFFSET[length] + length * NWORDS[length]
   DICTSIZE = DOFFSET[24] + 24 * NWORDS[24]
.fi

The offset of a word within the DICT array for a given length and
index is:

.nf
   offset(length, index) = DOFFSET[length] + index * length
.fi

Each static dictionary word has 121 different forms, given by
applying a word transformation to a base word in the DICT array. The
list of word transformations is given in Appendix B. The static
dictionary word for a <length, distance> pair can be reconstructed as
follows:

.nf
   word_id = distance - (max allowed distance + 1)
   index = word_id % NWORDS[length]
   base_word = DICT[offset(length, index)..offset(length, index+1)-1]
   transform_id = word_id >> NDBITS[length]
.fi

The string copied to the uncompressed stream is computed by applying the
transformation to the base dictionary word. If transform_id is
greater than 120, or the length is smaller than 4 or greater than 24, then
the compressed stream should be rejected as invalid.

Each word transformation has the following form:

.nf
   transform_i(word) = prefix_i + T_i(word) + suffix_i
.fi

where the _i subscript denotes the transform_id above. Each T_i
is one of the following 21 elementary transforms:

.nf
   Identity, UppercaseFirst, UppercaseAll,
   OmitFirst1, ..., OmitFirst9, OmitLast1, ..., OmitLast9
.fi

The form of these elementary transforms is as follows:

.nf
   Identity(word) = word

   UppercaseFirst(word) = first UTF-8 character of word upper-cased

   UppercaseAll(word) = all UTF-8 characters of word upper-cased

   OmitFirstk(word) = the last (length(word) - k) bytes of word, or
                      empty string if length(word) < k

   OmitLastk(word) = the first (length(word) - k) bytes of word, or
                     empty string if length(word) < k
.fi

For the purposes of UppercaseAll, word is parsed into UTF-8
characters and converted to upper-case by taking 1 - 3 bytes at a time,
using the algorithm below:

.nf
.KS
   i = 0
   while i < length(word):
      if word[i] < 192:
         if word[i] >= 97 and word[i] <= 122:
            word[i] = word[i] ^ 32
         i = i + 1
      else if word[i] < 224:
         if i + 1 < length(word):
            word[i + 1] = word[i + 1] ^ 32
         i = i + 2
      else:
         if i + 2 < length(word):
            word[i + 2] = word[i + 2] ^ 5
         i = i + 3
.KE
.fi

For UppercaseFirst, the same algorithm is used, but the loop is
executed only once.

Appendix B. contains the list of transformations by specifying the
prefix, elementary transform and suffix components of each of them.
Note that the OmitFirst8 elementary transform is not used in the list
of transformations. The strings in Appendix B. are in C string format
with respect to escape (backslash) characters.

The maximum number of additional bytes that a transform may add to a
base word is 13. Since the largest base word is 24 bytes long, a buffer
of 38 bytes is sufficient to store any transformed words
(counting a terminating zero byte).

9. Compressed data format

In this section we describe the format of the compressed data set in
terms of the format of the individual data items described in the
previous sections.

.ti 0
9.1. Format of the stream header

The stream header has only the following one field:

.nf
   1-7 bits: WBITS, a value in the range 10 - 24, encoded with
             the following variable length code (as it appears in
             the compressed data, where the bits are parsed from
             right to left):

                   Value    Bit Pattern
                   -----    -----------
                      10        0100001
                      11        0110001
                      12        1000001
                      13        1010001
                      14        1100001
                      15        1110001
                      16              0
                      17        0000001
                      18           0011
                      19           0101
                      20           0111
                      21           1001
                      22           1011
                      23           1101
                      24           1111

             Note that bit pattern 0010001 is invalid and must not
             be used.
.fi

The size of the sliding window, which is the maximum value of any
non-dictionary reference backward distance, is given by the
following formula:

.nf
   window size = (1 << WBITS) - 16
.fi

.ti 0
9.2. Format of the meta-block header

A compliant compressed data set has at least one meta-block. Each
meta-block contains a header with information about the
uncompressed length of the meta-block, and a bit signaling if the
meta-block is the last one. The format of the meta-block header is
the following:

.nf
   1 bit:  ISLAST, set to 1 if this is the last meta-block
   1 bit:  ISLASTEMPTY, if set to 1, the meta-block is empty;
           this field is only present if ISLAST bit is set -- if
           it is 1, then the meta-block and the brotli stream ends
           at that bit, with any remaining bits in the last byte
           of the compressed stream filled with zeros (if the
           fill bits are not zero, then the stream should be
           rejected as invalid)
   2 bits: MNIBBLES, # of nibbles to represent the uncompressed
           length, encoded with the following fixed-length code:

                 Value    Bit Pattern
                 -----    -----------
                     0             11
                     4             00
                     5             01
                     6             10

           If MNIBBLES is 0, the meta-block is empty, i.e. it does
           not generate any uncompressed data. In this case, the
           rest of the meta-block has the following format:

              1 bit:  reserved, must be zero

              2 bits: MSKIPBYTES, # of bytes to represent metadata
                      length

              MSKIPBYTES x 8 bits: MSKIPLEN - 1, where MSKIPLEN is
                      the number of metadata bytes; this field is
                      only present if MSKIPBYTES is positive,
                      otherwise MSKIPLEN is 0 (if MSKIPBYTES is
                      greater than 1, and the last byte is all
                      zeros, then the stream should be rejected
                      as invalid)

              0 - 7 bits: fill bits until the next byte boundary,
                      must be all zeros

              MSKIPLEN bytes of metadata, not part of the
                      uncompressed data or the sliding window

   MNIBBLES x 4 bits: MLEN - 1, where MLEN is the length
           of the meta-block uncompressed data in bytes (if
           MNIBBLES is greater than 4, and the last
           nibble is all zeros, then the stream should be
           rejected as invalid)

   1 bit:  ISUNCOMPRESSED, if set to 1, any bits of compressed
           data up to the next byte boundary are ignored, and
           the rest of the meta-block contains MLEN bytes of
           literal data; this field is only present if the
           ISLAST bit is not set (if the ignored bits are not
           all zeros, the stream should be rejected as invalid)

   1-11 bits: NBLTYPESL, # of literal block types, encoded with
           the following variable length code (as it appears in
           the compressed data, where the bits are parsed from
           right to left, so 0110111 has the value 12):

                    Value    Bit Pattern
                    -----    -----------
                      1                0
                      2             0001
                     3-4           x0011

                   129-256   xxxxxxx1111

      Prefix code over the block type code alphabet for
         literal block types, appears only if NBLTYPESL >= 2

      Prefix code over the block count code alphabet for

9.3. Format of the meta-block data

The compressed data part of a meta-block consists of a series of
commands. Each command has the following format:

.nf
      Block type code for next insert-and-copy block type, appears
         only if NBLTYPESI >= 2 and the previous insert-and-copy
         block count is zero

      Block count code + extra bits for next insert-and-copy
         block count, appears only if NBLTYPESI >= 2 and the
         previous insert-and-copy block count is zero

      Insert-and-copy length, encoded as in Section 5., using the
         insert-and-copy length prefix code with the current
         insert-and-copy block type index

      Insert length number of literals, with the following format:

         Block type code for next literal block type, appears
            only if NBLTYPESL >= 2 and the previous literal
            block count is zero

         Block count code + extra bits for next literal
            block count, appears only if NBLTYPESL >= 2 and the
            previous literal block count is zero

         Next byte of the uncompressed data, encoded with the
            literal prefix code with the index determined by the
            previous two bytes of the uncompressed data, the
            current literal block type, and the context map, as
            described in Section 7.3.

      Block type code for next distance block type, appears
         only if NBLTYPESD >= 2 and the previous distance
         block count is zero

      Block count code + extra bits for next distance
         block count, appears only if NBLTYPESD >= 2 and the
         previous distance block count is zero

      Distance code, encoded as in Section 4., using the distance
         prefix code with the current distance block type index,
         appears only if the distance code is not an implicit 0,
         as indicated by the insert-and-copy length code
.fi

The number of commands in the meta-block is such that the sum of
the uncompressed bytes produced (i.e. the number of literals inserted
plus the number of bytes copied from past data or generated from the
static dictionary) over all the commands gives the uncompressed length,
MLEN encoded in the meta-block header.

If the total number of uncompressed bytes produced after the insert part
of the last command equals MLEN, then the copy length of the last command
is ignored and will not produce any uncompressed output. In this case the
copy length of the last command can have any value. In any other case, if
the number of literals to insert, the copy length, or the resulting
dictionary word length would cause MLEN to be exceeded, then the stream
should be rejected as invalid.

If the last command of the last non-empty meta-block does not end on
a byte boundary, the unused bits in the last byte must be zeros.

10. Decoding algorithm

The decoding algorithm that produces the uncompressed data is as follows:

.nf
   read window size
   do
      read ISLAST bit
      if ISLAST
         read ISLASTEMPTY bit
         if ISLASTEMPTY
            break from loop
      read MNIBBLES
      if MNIBBLES is zero
         verify reserved bit is zero
         read MSKIPLEN
         skip any bits up to the next byte boundary
         skip MSKIPLEN bytes
         continue to the next meta-block
      else
         read MLEN
      if not ISLAST
         read ISUNCOMPRESSED bit
         if ISUNCOMPRESSED
            skip any bits up to the next byte boundary
            copy MLEN bytes of compressed data as literals
            continue to the next meta-block
      loop for each three block categories (i = L, I, D)
         read NBLTYPESi
         if NBLTYPESi >= 2
            read prefix code for block types, HTREE_BTYPE_i
            read prefix code for block counts, HTREE_BLEN_i
            read block count, BLEN_i
            set block type, BTYPE_i to 0
            initialize second-to-last and last block types to 0 and 1
         else
            set block type, BTYPE_i to 0
            set block count, BLEN_i to 16777216
      read NPOSTFIX and NDIRECT
      read array of literal context modes, CMODE[]
      read NTREESL
      if NTREESL >= 2
         read literal context map, CMAPL[]
      else
         fill CMAPL[] with zeros
      read NTREESD
      if NTREESD >= 2
         read distance context map, CMAPD[]
      else
         fill CMAPD[] with zeros
      read array of literal prefix codes, HTREEL[]
      read array of insert-and-copy length prefix codes, HTREEI[]
      read array of distance prefix codes, HTREED[]
      do
         if BLEN_I is zero
            read block type using HTREE_BTYPE_I and set BTYPE_I
               save previous block type
            read block count using HTREE_BLEN_I and set BLEN_I
         decrement BLEN_I
         read insert-and-copy length symbol using HTREEI[BTYPE_I]
         compute insert length, ILEN, and copy length, CLEN
         loop for ILEN
            if BLEN_L is zero
               read block type using HTREE_BTYPE_L and set BTYPE_L
                  save previous block type
               read block count using HTREE_BLEN_L and set BLEN_L
            decrement BLEN_L
            look up context mode CMODE[BTYPE_L]
            compute context ID, CIDL from last two uncompressed bytes
            read literal using HTREEL[CMAPL[64*BTYPE_L + CIDL]]
            write literal to uncompressed stream
         if number of uncompressed bytes produced in the loop for
            this meta-block is MLEN, then break from loop (in this
            case the copy length is ignored and can have any value)
         if distance code is implicit zero from insert-and-copy code
            set backward distance to the last distance
         else
            if BLEN_D is zero
               read block type using HTREE_BTYPE_D and set BTYPE_D
                  save previous block type
               read block count using HTREE_BLEN_D and set BLEN_D
            decrement BLEN_D
            compute context ID, CIDD from CLEN
            read distance code using HTREED[CMAPD[4*BTYPE_D + CIDD]]
            compute distance by distance short code substitution
            if distance code is not zero,
               and distance is not a static dictionary reference,
               push distance to the ring buffer of last distances
         if distance is less than the max allowed distance plus one
            move backwards distance bytes in the uncompressed data,
            and copy CLEN bytes from this position to
            the uncompressed stream
         else
            look up the static dictionary word, transform the word as
            directed, and copy the result to the uncompressed stream
      while number of uncompressed bytes for this meta-block < MLEN
   while not ISLAST
.fi

If the stream ends before the completion of the last meta-block, then
the stream should be rejected as invalid.

Note that a duplicated string reference may refer to a string in a
previous meta-block, i.e. the backward distance may cross one or
more meta-block boundaries. However a backward copy distance
will not refer past the beginning of the uncompressed stream or the
window size; any such distance is
interpreted as a reference to a static dictionary word. Also note
that the referenced string may overlap the current position, for
example, if the last 2 bytes decoded have values X and Y, a string
reference with <length = 5, distance = 2> adds X,Y,X,Y,X to the
uncompressed stream.

11. Security Considerations

As with any compressed file formats, decompressor implementations should
handle all compressed data byte sequences, not only those that conform to this
specification, where non-conformant compressed data sequences should be discarded.
A possible attack against a system containing a decompressor
implementation (e.g. a web browser) is to exploit a buffer
overflow caused by an invalid compressed data. Therefore decompressor
implementations should perform bounds-checking for each memory access
that result from values decoded from the compressed stream.

   The number of words for each length is given by the following
   bit-depth array:

      NDBITS :=  0,  0,  0,  0, 10, 10, 11, 11, 10, 10,
                10, 10, 10,  9,  9,  8,  7,  7,  8,  7,
                 7,  6,  6,  5,  5

Appendix B. List of word transformations

The string literals are in C format, with respect to the use of
backslash escape characters.

In order to generate a length and check value, the transforms can be converted
to a series of bytes, where each transform is the prefix sequence of bytes plus
a terminating zero byte, a single byte value identifying the transform, and the
suffix sequence of bytes plus a terminating zero. The value for the transforms
are 0 for Identity, 1 for UppercaseFirst, 2 for UppercaseAll, 3 to 11 for
OmitFirst1 to OmitFirst9, and 12 to 20 for OmitLast1 to OmitLast9. The byte
sequences that represent the 121 transforms are then concatenated to a single
sequence of bytes. The length of that sequence is 648 bytes, and the zlib CRC
is 0x3d965f81.
